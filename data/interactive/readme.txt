This example is to test interactive design.

"s_shape_mod.obj" is the mesh. Don't forget to unit-scale it after loading the mesh.
"s1*" are the strokes. Load it and it will be drawn on the mesh.
"smooth1.csv" is the scalar field follows the strokes.
"48p75_1.csv" and "48p75_1b.csv" are the scalar field and binormal vector field of \theta = 48.75. They are obtained by automatic optimization.
