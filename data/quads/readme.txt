This is to test extrating quad meshes from scalar fields, and quad mesh optimizations.
"tri.obj" is the triangle mesh
"60.csv" and "120.csv" are the two scalar fields.
"quad.obj" is the quad mesh extracted directly from the triangle mesh and the two scalar fields
"info*" are for the structural information of the quad mesh.
"quad_opt.obj" is the PP quad mesh whose binormal vectors of the two families of curves has desired inclination angles with the normal vectors.
